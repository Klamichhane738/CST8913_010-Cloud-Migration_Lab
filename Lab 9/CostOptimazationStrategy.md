# Recommended Cost Optimization Strategy for ShopPro International on GCP

To ensure cost-efficiency during ShopPro International’s migration to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the following strategies are recommended across migration, operational, and management phases. These approaches are designed to maintain high performance and resilience while controlling costs.

## 1. Migration Cost Optimization

### Recommended Strategies:
- **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):** Similar to Azure's "Hybrid Benefit," BYOL enables ShopPro to bring existing software licenses to GCP, reducing initial licensing and migration costs. Combining BYOL with a 3-year commitment plan further reduces migration expenses.
- **Utilize Efficient Data Transfer Tools:** Using Google’s Storage Transfer Service for bulk data migration minimizes manual transfer costs and streamlines large-scale data migration.
- **Limit Temporary Resource Duration:** Provision Compute Engine instances specifically for short-term migration needs to avoid long-term costs.
- **Adopt Short-Term Database Replication:** Use reserved database instances with a limited duration to control costs while ensuring data synchronization and availability during migration.

These strategies effectively manage migration-related costs by focusing on short-term, targeted resources for a cost-effective transition.

## 2. Operational Cost Optimization

### Recommended Strategies:
- **Leverage Reserved Instances for Predictable Workloads:** Secure 1-year and 3-year reserved instances for primary VM clusters across regions to gain significant savings for continuous workloads.
  - **Sample Pricing Difference for VM Commitments:**
    | Region            | VM Configuration          | Quantity | 3-Year Discounted | 1-Year Discounted |
    |-------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
    | South Carolina    | General purpose, n2-standard v4 | 7        | $577.99           | $794.40           |
    | Finland           | General purpose, n2-standard v4 | 7        | $633.19           | $871.41           |
    | Taiwan            | General purpose, n2-standard v4 | 6        | $556.08           | $765.78           |

- **Optimize Load Balancer Scope:** Deploy load balancers regionally instead of globally to align costs with localized traffic and reduce expenses.
- **Adjust CDN Configuration Based on Regional Needs:** Limit cache data transfer to regions with active usage to significantly reduce monthly CDN costs.
- **Right-Size VMs for Microservices Architecture:** Select VM instances that match the exact requirements of API back-end services. Configure reserved instances for necessary capacity without over-allocation.
- **Commit to Discounted Database Options:** Committing to 3-year discounts for databases like Cloud SQL and Bigtable ensures reduced pricing for ongoing database needs.

These strategies align operational resources with demand and effectively control recurring costs.

## 3. Management Cost Efficiency

### Recommended Strategies:
- **Implement Redundant Storage with Regional Efficiency:** For disaster recovery, use multi-regional storage within the same continent to maintain redundancy while avoiding high cross-continent data transfer costs.

- **Use Long-Term Commitments for Essential Databases:** Applying a 3-year commitment for critical services like Cloud Spanner provides reduced rates for long-term storage and database operations.
- **Monitor Key Metrics Selectively:** Track only essential VM and application metrics, and limit log retention to 2 months to balance insight needs with storage expenses.

By following these management cost strategies, ShopPro can achieve data resilience and operational oversight with minimal costs.

These recommended strategies support ShopPro International’s goals of building a scalable, cost-effective cloud infrastructure on GCP. By prioritizing targeted resource allocation, committed use discounts, and selective monitoring, ShopPro can sustainably manage costs while supporting growth and reliability.
